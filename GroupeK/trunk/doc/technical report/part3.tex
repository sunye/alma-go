\chapter{The controler}


The diagram on figure \ref{controler} represent the actual package of the controler.  As we can see the controler is all mighy, is "knows" the view and the model. The ActionListenerFactory just construct action listener for the different action, all the action are transfered to the controler that dispatch after. The controler does not do anything else than transfert action and reaction, it does not calcul anything.
